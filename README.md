# StudyTool
The idea for this java based application came about from my own experience of going through several coding bootcamps.

The need to study and retain new information in a short amount of time requires a structured approach. I wondered if a simple tool could help me do this and i created this app as an experiment to find out.
As a bonus, it also helps me apply and work on my skill set in several different areas.

It is very much a work in progress with many improvements to come.

I'm a big fan of study tools that incorporate spaced repetition, such as Duolingo, Tinycards, Quizlet and others.

My desire is to create an app that is configurable and will help you retain study information, by reminding you to study topics just before you forget about them.
